# Movie-Recommender-Python
Uses KNN to find similarity between Movies/Users and also recommends Movies.

A menu is drawn for finding similarity between movies and users.                                                                          
Also recommends movies and tells top users who watch almost same movies as input user.                                                    
The similarity can be found through 5 different formulas, such as Euclidiean, Jaccard etc                                                 
Ignore the graph part. Its just a random accuracy test. You can change the values in a way to find out the actual accuracy.               
A hybrid algorithm is used for finding the movie recommendations for the user.                                                            
The hybrid algorithm is mixture of content based and collaboration algorithms.
